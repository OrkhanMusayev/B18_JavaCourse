    1 "cybertek@yahoo.com", "cybertek@gmail.com", "cybertek@hotmail.com",
     "cybertek@outlook.com"  By using Array declare witch one has @gmail.com

     2 Store values at Array variable after declare array
     example: you have 3 array but you will give values later and  Get Arrays length

3 Create an array that holds 12 months namesUser should be able to enter
month index and output should be:“The month name is <MonthName>”
As long as user  addes invalid number print "re enter"
After 3 attempe declaer "you tried 3 times sorry sytem locked" ans exit program

4 Write a program that asks how many student user wants  and ask name
       and store each of the names in the array students

5 Second Way ---  Write a program that asks "enter a name" 10 times,
       and store each of the names in the array students

6  Second Way ---  Write a program that asks "enter a name" 10 times,
       and store each of the names in the array students

7  write a program that can find the maximum number from any given int array

8   write a program that can find the minimum number from any given int array

9   write a program by using while that can find the maximum number from any given
 int array which declared IN ADVANCE.

10  Create an array that holds 12 months namesUser should be able to enter
month index and output should be:“The month name is <MonthName>”.
USE "while" loop and ask user to" re enter" if user addes wrong month number
and after 3 attempts print " you tried 3 times" and exit system

11 Create int Array or String  and ask user  to STORE Array
 and declare them by calling Array from import java

12 Combine arrays  int arr1[]={1,2,3};  int arr2[]={4,5,6,7}; int arr3[]=

13 int[] arr5 = {3, 2, 1};  int[] arr6 = {2, 1, 3};  sort and check equals Arrays

14 sort char -{'Z', 'D', 'W', 'Y', 'A', 'B', 'E' , 'D' };

15 "Cybertek School";  "School Cybertek"; convert String to char array then
sort them and then check eguality

16 {"Deniz", "Osman", "Rustem",  "Anna", "Ali", "Adil"};  sort this String array

17 int[] arr11 = {3,1,4,-1,100, -100, 200, 155};
 [-100, -1, 1, 3, 4, 100, 155, 200]
[200, 155, 100, 4, 3, 1, -1, -100]
Declare ascending array then convert it descending array and print like this

18 Given a String array words, iterate through each word and print first and last letter of each element in separate lines.
Example:
words → ["hello", "why", "by", "apple" , "note"]
print:
       ho
       wy
       by
       ae
       ne

19 The code provided in your main method will take in five Strings and
 save them into an array called arr.  Print out the first three letter of
  each element of arr, one per line.  You can assume that every element of
  arr is at least 3 letters long.
Example:
arr -> ["apple", "banana"]
 prints: app
         ban

  20  Given an array of ints, print true if the array contains a 5 next
   to a 5 anywhere in the array. If no consecutive 5s or no 5s are
   detected in your code then print false.
nums → [1, 5, 5, 1, 1] → true
nums → [1, 8, 5, 5, 0] → true
nums → [1, 5, 4, 1, 5] → false
nums → [1, 4, 4, 1, 99] → false

21 Given a String array words, iterate through each word and print first
 and last letter of each element in the format below.
Example:
words → ["hello", "why", "by", "apple" , "note"]
print → [ho, wy, by, ae, ne]

22  Given an array nums, calculate count of even numbers in nums and
print out to console.
nums → [2, 1, 2, 3, 4]) → 3
nums → [2, 2, 0, 3, 5]) → 3
nums → [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) → 0

23  Given an array nums with 7 integers every element is repeated twice
 - except one. Find that element and print it to console.
Example:
nums -> [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4]
         2

24  Given the array words, it will print the word with the largest length.

25  1. write a program that can return the longest string of text from an array
    2. write a program that can return the shortest string of text from an array

26    Write a program that can return the average number from an array of
 integers
  ex:
  [1,2,3]
   average:
      [10, 15, 5, 6]
 average: 9
  [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 20, 30, 0]
 average: 10

 27  DecimalFormat ,  rounding the decimals

 28 By using char array and for loop  declare this {'d','c','a','b'};
 like abcd

 29  String str ="Today is great day" ;declare as Array [Today, is, great, day]
then reverse Array[Today, is, great, day] to >  day great is Today

30  String str2 = "ABCD";  get String    //["A", "B", "C", "D"]
and char //['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']

31  int[] nums  = {1, 2, 3, 4}; use for eeach loop to get 1 2 3 4

32   String[] students = {"Muhtar", "Asiya", "Murodil"}; use for each
to get Muhtar Asiya Murodil

33    int[] arr1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}; use each for loop
to get 5,6,7,8,9,10

34     String sentnce = "I like Java";  split thema nd use for each to get
I
lIKE
Java
THEN REVERSE THEM
Java
like
I

35  given an array:
    String[] emails = {"cybertek@gmail.com", "cybertek@yahoo.com",
     "cybertek@hotmail.com", "cybertek@outlook.com"}
elemnts could be more in the array
 prin all the email addresses excluding the gmail addresses
  NOTE: MUST USE FOR EACH LOOP

 36   //                      0        1         2         3
        String[] DevTeam = {"Zeynep", "Haider", "Jovid", "Muhtar"};
        String[] TestersTeam = {"Rahman", "Aishan", "Osman", "Ali"};
        String[] PO = {"Barzy", "Donald"};
        String[] TestersTeam2  ={"Ilham", "Zarina", "Aizhan", "Asiman"} ;
Creat SCRUM TEam ARRAY AND ADD Devteam,Testersteam,Po into scrum team then
change  "Muhtar" to "Jean" in devtean, and then change Testerteam with
 Testerteam 2 in Scrum Team Array then declear "Jean" from devteam ,Aizhan from
 Testerteam2 and then declear whole Testerteam2 and then declaer "Donald"
 from Po team

 37 {  { 1, 2, 3} ,  { 4, 5, 6, 7}   };
 Creat 2 singel  Array then create multi dimensional Array and
 put 2 singel array into multi dimensional array then declear multi dimensional
 Aray's length then creat new array and assign second single array
 from multi demensional to new array and declaer new array and then declear 7

 38  {  {'A', 'B' } ,  {'D', 'E', 'F'} ,  {'G', 'H', 'I'} };
  Creat  char multi demensional Array and then put three single dimencional
 array and put 3 values into  each single dimencional array  and then
 assign 'D' to char variable and {'G', 'H', 'I'} to another char variable and print them

 39 {  {"A", "B", "C"},   {"D", "E", "F"},  {"J", "H", "I"}
 Creat String multi dimencional Array and then declear "H"

40  {1,2,3};  creat single dimensional array and print it like this [1, 2, 3]
Create multi dimensional array   {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}; and declare like this
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

41 {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}} ,     {{7,8,9},{10,11,12}
create multi demencional array and declare this [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6] then
[4, 5, 6]  then  12

42   {"Tiger", "Lion", "Monkey", "Turtle", "Corcodile"};
 {"Eagle", "Ducks", "Peacock","Chicken"};
These are single dimencional Arrays. Create multi dimencional Array name is
zoo and put these into zoo then create String and assign  "Chicken from zoo to new String and print
"Chiken" then declear all animals excluding "Chiken" from zoo,then declear all animlas excluding
"Turtle"  from zoo

43  1. create an int array called numbers that has length of 100
        2. assign 1~100 to the array' each indexes
        3. use for each loop to rpint out all the even numbers.
                MUst use continue statement

44 Ask user "how many number he wants to add?"then fill out this int array {};
and then REVERSE and  print this 5 4 3 2 1 and the array   [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

45    3. write a program that can return the number of appearances of
"java" and "python" anywhere in the sentence---"I Like java and javascript";

46  {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
 write a program that can count the even and odd number from an array of integers
and print out odd and even numbers ether
                        MUST use for each loop

  47 {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}};  print this multi dimensional array like this.
