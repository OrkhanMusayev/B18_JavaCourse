1. create a custom class for pizza that should contain the following:
                instance variables:
                        size (either small, medium, large)
                        number of cheese topping
                        number of pepperoni toppings
                Add a constructor that can allow user to set the size and toppisngs of the pizza
                instance method:
                        calcCost(): returns the total cost as double
                        toString(): a String return method that's containing the pizza' size, quantity of each topping, and the pizza cost as calculated by calcCost()
                Pizza cost is determined by:
                        Small: $10 + $1.5 per pepperoni topping + 1 per cheese topping
                        Medium: $12 + $1.5 per pepperoni topping + 1 per cheese topping
                        Large: $14 + $1.5 per pepperoni topping + 1 per cheese topping
    create a class called Order
            create five objects of the pizza
            create an arraylist of pizza and add those 5 objects into it
            calculate the total price of the order (use for each loop)


Task02:
    Create a class called Circle
            instance variables:
                    radius, pi, diameter
            add a constructor that can initialize the radius of the circle
            instance methods:
                    area(): can return the area of the circle as double
                    perimeter(): cna return the perimeter of the circle as double
                    toString(): returns the info of the circle
            Note: global value of PI is 3.14
                  diameter of circle = 2 * radius
                  area of circle = PI * r * r
Task03:
    Create class called SalaryCalculator
            instance variables:
                hourlyRate, weeklyHours, stateTaxRate, fedralTaxRate
            add a constructor can initialize those fields
            instance methods:
                salary(): returns the total salary as double
                salaryAftertax(): retuns the salary after tax as double
                stateTax(): retuns the total state tax as double
                federalTax(): retuns the total federal tax as double
                toString(): returns the hourlyRate, weeklyHours and salary info based os salary() method
