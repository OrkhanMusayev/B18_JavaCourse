    1. write a program that can reverse the array
    2. write a program that sort the array in descending order
    3. write a program that can return the number of appearances of "java" and "python" anywhere in the sentence
                (it's similar to the task 97 in repl.it, But this time you MUST use arrays and for each loop)
    4. write a program that can count the even and odd number from an array of integers
                        MUST use for each loop


// NIGHT WARMUP TASKS:
      Task01:
             1. create an int array called numbers that has length of 100
             2. assign 1~100 to the array' each indexes
             3. use for each loop to print out all the even numbers.
                     MUst use continue statement
         Task02:
             1. Write a program that will take five Strings and save them into an array called arr.
             2. use for each loop to print out the first three letter of each element of arr, one per line. You can assume that every element of arr is at least 3 letters long.
                 Example:
                     arr -> ["apple", "banana"]
                     prints: app
                             ban

1.  write a program that can check if two Strings are build out of same
        Ex:
            if str1 = "aabbbc";  str2 ="cab";
            output: true
            if str1 ="abcd";  str2 ="abc";
            output: false
            Hint: you will need array and Arrays' methods
2.  Write a program that can print out the unique values from an int Array
        Ex:
            if arr -> {1,1,2,3,3}
            output: 2
            if arr -> {1,2,2,3,4,4}
            output:  1  3
3. Write a program that can print out the unique values from  String Array
